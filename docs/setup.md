# Setup

Install the Plugin as you would any other plugin & activate it. The plugin is also available via [packagist](TBD), if you prefer an installation via composer.

After installation you need to add your credentials on the plugin settings page. As well as define on which woocommerce states you want your fulfillment triggered.
